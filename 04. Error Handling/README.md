# Error Handling and Exception Management in Python

Error handling and exception management are crucial aspects of Python programming to gracefully handle unexpected errors and exceptions. Python provides robust mechanisms for identifying, handling, and raising exceptions.

## Try-Except Blocks

**Try-Except Blocks:** Use a `try` block to wrap code that may raise exceptions, while `except` blocks catch and handle specific types of exceptions.

```python
# Example: Try block
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handle specific exception
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
```

## Handling Multiple Exceptions

**Handling Multiple Exceptions:** Use multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

```python
# Example: Try block to handle file operations
try:
    file = open("file.txt", "r")
    contents = file.read()
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError: # Handle FileNotFoundError exception
    print("Error: File not found!")
except IOError: # Handle Input/output operations error
    print("Error: Unable to read file!")
```

## Else and Finally Blocks

**Else Block:** An `else` block is executed if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.
**Finally Block:** A `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is often used for cleanup actions.

```python
# Example: Try block to handle file operations
try:
    file = open("file.txt", "r")
    contents = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError: # Handle FileNotFoundError exception
    print("Error: File not found!")
else: # Execute if no exception occurs
    print("File contents:", contents)
finally: # Execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
    if 'file' in locals(): # Check if the 'file' variable is defined in the local scope
        file.close()
```

## Raising Exceptions

**Raising Exceptions:** Use the `raise` statement to indicate error conditions in your code.

```python
x = -5
if x < 0:
    raise ValueError("Invalid value: x must be non-negative")
```

## Custom Exception Classes

**Custom Exception Classes:** Define custom exception classes by subclassing built-in exception classes or the Exception base class.

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    file = open("file.txt", "r")  # open the file "file.txt" in read mode
    contents = file.read()  # Read the contents of the file
    
    # Example of raising a CustomError
    if contents.strip() == "":
        raise CustomError("File is empty")  # Raise CustomError if the file is empty
except CustomError as e:
    print("Custom error:", e)
except FileNotFoundError: # Handle FileNotFoundError exception
    print("Error: File not found!")
else: # Execute if no exception occurs
    print("File contents:", contents)
finally: # Execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
    if 'file' in locals(): # Check if the 'file' variable is defined in the local scope
        file.close()
```

These techniques empower Python developers to write robust and resilient code capable of handling errors and exceptions effectively.
