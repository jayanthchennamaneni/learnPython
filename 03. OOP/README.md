## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models real-world entities as objects with attributes (properties) and methods (behaviors). Python supports OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, facilitating better code organization and reusability.

### Concepts of OOP:

1. **Classes and Objects:**
   - A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes and methods.
   - An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific instance with its own data and behavior.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) can inherit properties and behavior from an existing class (superclass or parent class).
   - Subclasses can extend or override the functionality of the superclass.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
   - It allows methods to have different implementations based on the object they are called on.

4. **Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
   - It hides the internal state of objects from the outside, and only exposes the necessary interfaces for interaction.


### Classes and Objects

A class defines the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are instances of classes with specific attributes and methods.

### Defining a Class

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age): # Constructor to initialize name and age attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self): #  # Method to greet the person
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."
```

### Creating Objects (Instances)

```python
# Creating objects of the Person class
person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit properties and methods from a superclass, promoting code reuse and hierarchical relationships.

### Defining a Subclass

```python
class Student(Person): # a class Student inheriting from the Person class
    def __init__(self, name, age, student_id): # Initializes Student object with name, age, and student_id
        super().__init__(name, age) # Call the constructor of the parent class to initialize name and age attributes
        self.student_id = student_id

    def study(self, subject): # Method to indicate that the student is studying a subject
        return f"{self.name} is studying {subject}."
```

### Creating Objects of Subclass

```python
# Creating objects of the Student class
student1 = Student("Eve", 22, "S12345")
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in the code.

### Example of Polymorphism

```python
# Function that accepts objects of different classes
def introduce(person):
    return person.greet()

#By using polymorphism, the introduce function can accept objects of different classes (Person and Student) as long as they have a greet method.
print(introduce(person1))   # Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."
print(introduce(student1))  # Output: "Hello, my name is Eve and I am 22 years old."
```

These OOP concepts empower developers to create modular, maintainable, and extensible code in Python.
